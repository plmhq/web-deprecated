<h4 class="text-center"> Intramuros: Origins of a Capital City </h4>

<p> The PLM is located in the historic vicinity of Intramuros, immortalized in history as the Walled City during the three centuries of Spanish colonization and was built to become the fortress enclave of the Spanish conquistadores and later, the Spanish King's viceroys and governors-general to the Philippines appointed by the Royal Court to head this Spanish Colony. It was where the now City of Manila began with a population of 250 after its foundation on 24 June 1571 as the capital of the Philippines, after which the capital city was honored by the King of Spain with a coat-of-arms and a grandiose title "Insigne y Siempre Leal Ciudad" or "Distinguished and Ever Faithful" or "Noble and Ever Loyal," about a month after the sovereignty of Spain was installed on 18 May 1571 by Don Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, a Spanish conquistador, in honor of King Philip II. He proclaimed Manila as the capital of the Spanish East Indies in 1571 and the permanent seat of the Spanish colonial government in the western Pacific Ocean. </p>

<p> During the three centuries of Spanish colonialism, Intramuros served as the seat of power, both of the government and the clergy. As the seat of the Church and the State, Intramuros was a witness to the famous Galleon Trade with Acapulco, having been located along the long stretch of the ever-famous Manila Bay, one of the world's finest and best natural harbors, where Manila was then developed to be a major port to pave a way for an intensified trade and commerce activities and massive industrialization of the pueblos around it. </p>

<p> Intramuros was shaped like a pentagon with a perimeter of 4 kilometers long, located along the delta of land at the mouth of the Pasig River, along its southern bank, which through hundreds of years has evolved into a foreshore as it used to be a part of the sea which reached as far as the present city of Mandaluyong ("a place of waves") and Makati ("a place of tides"). </p>

<p> Today, substantial sections of the encircling wall, which was begun in 1590 and restored in 1970s, remain, including a number of decorated gates, one of which leads to the campus of PLM. </p>

<h4 class="text-center"> Maynila: A Great Island of the Ancient Kingdom of Maynilad </h4>

<p> Long before the discovery of the Philippines by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521, the site of the Walled City has already been a portion of a settlement of early Filipino ancestors with their own style of government known as barangay or balangay, led and ruled by brave datus (royalty), rajahs and lakans (kings), gats (rulers), and the maharlikas (nobles) of the pre-Spanish era. </p>

<p> This pre-Hispanic island settlement where Intramuros was built up was known as Maynila, said to be last ruled by Rajah Soliman, a young king and a descendant from one of the two waves of barangay expeditions coming from Java or Sumatra during the 10th century, particularly the Tagalog ("taga-ilog" - of the river) pilgrim, the other one being the Pampango ("taga-pampang" - of the seashore). Maynila was composed of about thirty (30) families. Intelligent as the community was, it has nurtured its own culture and has developed its own system of writing, known as Alibata. Maynila ("May Nilad" - there's a Nilad) took its name from the star-shaped, white-flowered mangrove plant of Nilad which has grown abundant in the kingdom of Maynila. </p>

<p> The ancient Maynilad, already then an established entreport and prosperous center of international trade and commerce, as well as a political and military center of the region, was also the seat of power for native chiefs who ruled the area before the Spaniards set foot on Philippine soil. </p>

<p> Long before the conquest of Manila by the Spanish explorers led by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, Maynila used to be a fortification of palisade of palm logs and banked earth ruled by Rajah Sulayman – though even then the city limits extended well beyond the Malay settlement to encompass what is today the Manila Cathedral site and the adjoining land up to where San Agustin Church still stands. </p>

<h4 class="text-center"> PLM: An Opulent Chamber of Continuing Intellectual Pursuits </h4>

<p> The land on which the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila stands is a revered ground, replete with history, theology and education -- right at the very heart and core of Manila, the country's capital city. </p>

<p> At the site now occupied by PLM was situated the Colegio de Manila, a.k.a. Colegio Maximo de San Ignacio, the first college run by the Jesuits in the Philippines and founded in 1590 by Fr. Antonio Sedeño, S.J. It was the first school in the Philippines and formally accepted students in 1595. During those times, the Jesuits were reputed to be the best educators of Spain, and perhaps of Europe. The college was eventually granted a university status in 1621 and was thereby transformed into Universidad de San Ignacio. The church of the college, first known as the Iglesia de Santa Ana, was the first stone church in the Philippines. It was built in 1590 along with the Walled City of Intramuros and eventually opened in 1596, but was later destroyed by a strong earthquake in 1599. This church of the Universidad de San Ignacio was reconstructed with a much bigger structure in 1626 and was named in honor of San Ignacio de Loyola (St. Ignatius of Loyola). </p>

<p> On 25 August 1601, the Colegio de San Jose, also located within the vicinity, was set up as an adjunct of the Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio. Twenty years later, Pope Gregory XV, through the Archbishop of Manila, authorized the Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio to confer degrees in theology and arts, and elevated it into a university (Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio). In 1623, Colegio de San Jose was granted the right to confer academic titles by virtue of the royal decree of King Felipe IV of Spain, making the school both a pontifical and a royal university, and the very first university in the Philippines and Asia. In 1722, the Colegio de San Jose was granted a royal patronage and was conferred the title "Colegio Ad Honorem." </p>

<p> The year 1768 saw the departure of the Jesuits, thus, the buildings were transformed into the seminary of the Diocesians. The college was converted into a liberal arts college under a secular administration until it was transferred to the Dominicans in 1875. From 1784 to 1880, it was the site of Real Seminario Conciliar de San Carlos. In 1895, the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio merged with the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of the Universidad Sancti Thomae (University of Santo Tomas). The Colegio de San Jose is now the San Jose Major Seminary at the Ateneo de Manila University. </p>

<p> The buildings were later used as military headquarters called Cuartel del Rey, and later, Cuartel de España. Dr. Jose P. Rizal, the country's national hero, was tried on false charges of sedition on 26 December 1896 for his love of country, nationalism, patriotism and enlightened liberalism. </p>

<p> During the American Occupation until 1941, the buildings and the whole premises served as military headquarters of the 31st Infantry Division of the United States prior to the outbreak of the Second World War when Major Gen. Douglas MacArthur was recalled to active service to head the United States Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). The area fell under the hands of the Japanese Imperial Army on 02 January 1942 after Manila was declared an "Open City" until the country's liberation from the Japanese Occupation.  </p>

<p> After the "War of the Giants" which left Manila in ruins, this 2.8-hectare lot was developed and later occupied by the Manila High School. It was a school that produced Philippine presidents, including Jose P. Laurel, Manuel A. Roxas and Elpidio Quirino. Former Chief Justice Jose Yulo and hero General Basilio Valdes also studied here. </p>

<p> On 01 April 1967, PLM formally occupied and took over the land and building vacated by the Manila High School which President Diosdado P. Macapagal sought to grant to PLM under Presidential Proclamation No. 392-A dated 24 April 1965 to spur the renaissance of a new era of educational excellence. The grounds where the University is located was conveyed by the Republic of the Philippines to the City of Manila on 05 February 1970, through the efforts of former Manila Councilor Ernesto M. Maceda, then Executive Secretary of President Ferdinand E. Marcos. This land was later transferred by the City Government to the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. </p>

<p> PLM comes as a delightful mix and synergy of the old and the new: of age-old and time-honored academic tradition pioneered in the country centuries ago, and of modern-day scholarly education and scientific innovations. PLM stands proudly on a stately historical landmark which is a home for academic and scholarly advancement and erudition for more than four centuries with its rich history of eminent intellectual pursuits. The beacon of outstanding academic excellence, proudly as it is a birthright of Pamantasan, has likewise been a centuries-old tradition of this side of Intramuros by which every member of the Pamantasan community carries with utmost dignity, pride and honor. </p>

<p> The PLM is the place for the realization of the hopes, dreams and aspirations of the youth of Manila. And with all the history that has taken place not only in Intramuros, but also on the same land where the PLM stands, it is but fitting that the youth of Manila come here to fulfill the Filipino dream. </p>
