<h4> Historical evolution and accomplishments of the University </h4>

As part of PLM's institutional memory, this page chronicles the historical milestones of the life of the University from the time it formally operated on July 17, 1967. Through the years, PLM evolved and metamorphosed from its early foundation as to what it is today: the youngest among the league of best universities in the Philippines.
