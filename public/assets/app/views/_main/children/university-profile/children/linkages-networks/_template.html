<h5> Uplifting Institutional Performances </h5>

<p> The ties that bind PLM and numerous agencies, organizations, or institutions of higher learning augur well for the upgrading of the institution, staff, and student capability-building initiatives. Complementation and resource sharing contributes in uplifting institutional performance for PLM and its partners. Such translate to more scholarships, on-the-job training, human resource building, research, academic promotion and civic responsibility.

<h5> Growing Institutional Contacts </h5>
<p> Other institutional connections for its off-campus programs on both undergraduate and graduate degrees in management, nursing and health sciences have been made possible. Partner institutions previously included the Southville International School and Colleges in Las Pinas City; World CITI Colleges in Quezon City; the Asia Pacific College of Advanced Studies in Balanga, Bataan; Lyceum of Batangas; Department of Education; Department of Budget and Management; and the Philippine National Police.

<h5> Ramon Magsaysay Awardees as Mentors </h5>
<p> The Ramon Magsaysay Awards Foundation, secretariat of the widely-respected Asian version of the Nobel Peace Prize, has been a strong partner for public and civic leadership. PLM brings in the awardees of the Ramon Magsaysay Awards Foundation as mentors in the graduate school programs in government management, both locally and overseas. The awardees, coming from diverse aspects of leadership from various nations in Asia, have also graced a series of lectures that have become an annual staple for the PLM community.

<h4> International </h4>

<h5> Global Inroads </h5>
<p> Making inroads to other parts of the globe was strengthened. The tie-up with the Second Philippine International School (SPIS), which is recognized by the Education Ministry of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Philippine’s Department of Education, caters to the educational needs of children of overseas Filipino in the Kingdom. </p>

<p> The lines of collaboration were earlier extended to other high education institutions and cultural agencies such as the following: University of Nebraska, USA; University of Indonesia and Gadjah Mada University, Indonesia; National Polytechnic Institute of Tolouse in France; National University of Singapore; and Sukhotai Thammahirat Open University in Thailand. </p>

<p> Of recent collaboration is with the Thepsatri Rajabhat University in Thailand. Much earlier, PLM was in tandem with the City College of San Francisco in USA, which allowed for faculty and student exchange. It also offered opportunities for faculty and instructional development. </p>

Gaining a Global Presence
<p> Appropriate tie-ups contribute to open boundaries and the demarcation line between PLM and the world. As PLM remains a local university sporting a Filipino name, its national presence is felt more than ever, and its reach steadily goes on worldwide trek. </p>

<p> On 07 July 2008, Hon. Goli Ameri, US Asst. Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs and representing the US Secretary of State, visited PLM and said in an address to PLM scholars that the US government had provided opportunities to less-privileged but talented students through its English Access Scholarship Program, Undergraduate Summer Program, Youth Exchange and Study Program, and Global Undergraduate Program. </p>

<p> Apart from the US student exchange programs and scholarships and partnership with the City College of San Francisco, PLM maintains international cooperation with other reputable schools in the world. These include: </p>
